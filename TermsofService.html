        <h2>A Summary:</h2>
        <p><strong>⚠ Please note: This is a summarized version of the Terms of Service. For a more clear and comprehensive understanding, specially for a long project, please refer to the full document below the summary. ⚠</strong></p>
        <p>
        <p>By commissioning artwork, the Client agrees to the Terms of Service (ToS), including respectful communication and anti-discrimination policies. The process involves contacting the Artist, discussing details like style and pricing, and making a payment, typically via Stripe or Paypal, before work begins.</p>
        <p>The Client provides project details and inspiration, and the Artist includes up to three minor revisions; additional changes may incur extra fees. Regular updates are provided, and the final artwork is delivered digitally after full payment.</p>
        <p>The Artist retains copyright but grants the Client personal, non-commercial usage rights with proper credit. Commercial use requires separate negotiation. Unauthorized reproduction, including AI replication, is prohibited and may lead to legal action.</p>
        <p>Refunds are rarely available once work starts, except under specific conditions. The Artist can terminate the agreement if the Client is unresponsive, breaches terms, or is disrespectful. Legal disputes follow the Artist's local jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>The Privacy Policy ensures the confidentiality of personal information retained for up to a month post-completion unless otherwise agreed. Updates to the ToS are communicated, with continued use implying acceptance.</p>
        <p>Both Artist and Client may, together, when discussing the process beforehand, overwrite some of the terms outlined here.</p>
        <p>Commissioning artwork is a fun process, and both parties aim to create a positive experience! ♡</p>
